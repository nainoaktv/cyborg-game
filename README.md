The original plan for this Cyborg Game was an action game where the player will start with 3 lives and fight against waves of enemies. However, due to sprite image dimension issues I was unable to implement this version of the game at this time. I will continue to refactor this project and pursue my original idea for the game in the future and attempt to fix the sprite issue.
